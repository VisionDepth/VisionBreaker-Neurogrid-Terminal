# VisionBreaker: Neurogrid Terminal

VisionBreaker: Neurogrid Terminal is a cyberpunk terminal toy and logic puzzle game built with Pygame.

You boot into a simulated grid, watch cascading code rain, and jack into a hidden puzzle layer. Solve terminal riddles to neutralize the TRACE system and unlock new visual themes as the Neurogrid bends to your will.

> Part ambient code rain visualizer, part minimal puzzle game.
